A Haskell implementation of a minimalist Among us imitations with a few levels, playable
from the terminal. The game includes the implementation of an AI game algorithm, the A*
algorithm, which can be used to take smart decisions on reaching the target faster.

To install PSQueue run the following command:
      stack install PSQueue
      
To run the checker:
      stack exec ghci TestMTS.hs (if PSQueue dependency has been added into stack.yml)
      stack exec ghci --package PSQueue TestMTS.hs (works without modifying stack.yml)
 
      *TestMTS.hs> checkAll                            ---> runs all tests
      *TestMTS.hs> vmCheckIO [ list_of_tests_to_run ]  ---> runs a number of tests,
                                                            with the following possible values:
                                                    [ testEmptyGame,
                                                      testAddHunter,
                                                      testAddGateway,

                                                      testIsTargetKilled,

                                                      testInsertSuccs,
                                                      testAStarTreeGoal,

To play in commandline:
      stack exec ghci Interactive.hs (if PSQueue dependency has been added into stack.yml)
      stack exec ghci --package PSQueue Interactive.hs (works without modifying stack.yml)
 
      *Interactvie.hs> interactive $ loadGame "terrains/terrain-1.txt" [goNorth, goSouth] [(0, 1)]
                        --> starts the game with field 1 map
                        --> exit using CTRL + C

      *Interactvie.hs> hunt True $ loadGame "terrains/terrain-1.txt" [goNorth, goSouth] [(0, 1)]
                        --> starts the game with field 1 map
                        --> press ENTER to perform the decision chosen by the A* algorithm
